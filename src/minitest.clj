;; ## When and How to run tests
;;
;; For now, tests are run multiple times because the "tests" macro registers
;; and also runs the tests.
;; What I suggest or understood from your requirements:
;; - [âˆš] tests have absolutely no impact in production (i.e. the macro expands
;;       to nothing).
;; - [ ] when tests are run via the clj test runner or explicitly in the repl
;;       with the test! fn:
;;       - successes: reported.
;;       - failures:  reported.
;; - [ ] when tests are *implicitly* run from the repl:
;;       - successes: silenced.
;;       - failures: reported.

;; ## Implicitly run tests
;; In development (.i.e not in production), tests are run implicitly:
;; - [ ] unless it is disabled by a flag.
;; - [ ] when the first "tests" block in a ns is executed, tests for this ns
;;      are cleared.
;; - [ ] when the last "tests" block in a ns is executed, it runs the tests for
;;       this ns.
